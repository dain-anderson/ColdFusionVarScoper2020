# ColdFusionVarScoper2020
Crude but mildly effective utility to find un-scoped variables in your CFML CFScript or CFCs.

The software piggy-backs on Mike Schierberl's VarScoper (https://github.com/mschierberl/varscoper) project, but also takes advantage of the cfml.parsing (https://github.com/denuno/cfml.parsing) and cfml.dictionary (https://github.com/denuno/cfml.dictionary) projects for newer CFC syntax.

Checkout to a web-accessible folder and run.
